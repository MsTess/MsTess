- 👋 Hi, I’m @MsTess! I'm from the U.S. and I currently live in the U.K.
- 👀 I’m interested in any sort of activity that allows for creative expression. I have been teaching language and literature for eight years.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, Javascript, Ruby, CSS and how to grow new ligament tissue in shoulder.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything that allows me to grow as a developer. I recently discovered that I absolutely love frontend development--though I have a lot to learn!
- 📫 How to reach me ...
